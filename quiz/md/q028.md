### Q028

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct A {
    A() { std::cout << "A"; }
    A(const A &a) { std::cout << "B"; }
    virtual void f() { std::cout << "C"; }
};

int main() {
    A a[2];
    for (auto x : a) {
        x.f();
    }
}
```

### Explain

When the array is initialized, the default constructor is called once for each of the two objects in it.

Then we iterate over the array using auto, which in our case is deduced to be `A`, This means the copy constructor will be called before `f()` for each iteration
