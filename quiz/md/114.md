### Explain

The cv-qualifiers apply to the pointer and not to the object pointed to.

In the code above, the object `s` is non-const, and so its members all retain their default const-ness and all calls through them invoke the non-const version of `C::foo()`, but 'p2' is const, so it invoke the const version of `C::foo()`.

`r` refers to its object as a const instance of `S`. That const-ness changes the behavior of its member `v`, an `std::vector` which is "const-correct" in the sense that its `operator[]` returns `const C &` and therefore invokes the const version of `C::foo()`.
