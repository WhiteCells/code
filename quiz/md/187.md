### Explain

On the first line, C c1;, the object c1 is default initialized, so the default constructor is called, printing 1.

On the second line, C c2 = c1;, the object c2 is copy initialized, so the copy constructor is called, printing 2. (Note that no assignment is taking place, even though there's a = involved.)
