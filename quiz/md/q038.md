### Q038

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int a = 0;
    decltype((a)) b = a;
    b++;
    std::cout << a << b;
}
```

### Explain

"The type denoted by decltype(e) is deﬁned as follows:
- if e is an unparenthesized id-expression naming a structured binding, decltype(e) is the referenced type as given in the specification of the structured binding declaration;
— if e is an unparenthesized id-expression or an unparenthesized class member access, decltype(e) is the type of the entity named by e. If there is no such entity, or if e names a set of overloaded functions, the program is ill-formed;
— otherwise, if e is an xvalue, decltype(e) is T&&, where T is the type of e;
— otherwise, if e is an lvalue, decltype(e) is T&, where T is the type of e;
— otherwise, decltype(e) is the type of e."

Because a is encapsulated in parentheses, it doesn't qualify for the first case, it is treated as an lvalue, therefore b's type is int&, not int.
