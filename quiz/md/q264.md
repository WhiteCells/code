### Q264

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct C {
    C() = default;
    int i;
};

int main() {
    const C c;
    std::cout << c.i;
}
```

### Explain

This is not allowed since it is `const` and `C` has a defaulted (not user-provided) constructor.

There are several ways we could make `C` const-default-constructible:

- Give `int i` a default member initializer: `int i {0}`.
- Remove `= default` from the constructor, and instead do `C::C() = default;` separately outside the class definition. This constructor now counts as user-provided.
- Manually provide a constructor: `C() {}`.
