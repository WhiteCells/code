### Explain

The sizes of the standard integer types are not fixed by the standard. It's perfectly legal to for instance have an implementation where both long and int are 32 bits.

There are five standard signed integer types : “signed char”, “short int”, “int”, “long int”, and “long long int”. In this list, each type provides at least as much storage as those preceding it in the list. (...) Plain ints have the natural size suggested by the architecture of the execution environment 47 ; the other signed integer types are provided to meet special needs.

int must also be large enough to contain any value in the range [INT_MIN, INT_MAX], as defined in the header <climits>.
