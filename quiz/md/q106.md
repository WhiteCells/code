    The program is undefined

### Explain

A declaration directly contained in a linkage-specification is treated as if it contains the extern specifier for the purpose of determining the linkage of the declared name and whether it is a definition.
extern "C" int x; //is just a declaration
extern "C" { int y; } //is a definition

"Every program shall contain exactly one definition of every non-inline function or variable that is odr-used in that program outside of a discarded statement; no diagnostic required."

The result: x is never defined but it is optional for the compiler to print an error. The behaviour of this program is undefined.
