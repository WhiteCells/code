### Q190

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct A {
    A(int i) : m_i(i) {}
    operator bool() const {
        return m_i > 0;
    }
    int m_i;
};

int main() {
    A a1(1), a2(2);
    std::cout << a1 + a2 << (a1 == a2);
}
```

### Explain

For both `a1 + a2` and `a1 == a2`ï¼Œthe built-in operators `operator+` and `operator==` for `int` is used. The two objects `a1` and `a2` are implicitly converted first to `bool` and then to `int` before calling the operator. In both cases, they convert first to `true`, then to `1`.
