### Q125

```cpp
#include <iostream>

template<class T>
void f(T) {
    static int i = 0;
    std::cout << ++i;
}

int main() {
    f(1);
    f(1.1);
    f(1);
}
```

### Explain

Each function template specialization instantiated from a template has its own copy of any static variable.

This means we get two instantiations of `f`, one for `T`=`int`, and one for `T`=`double`. Thus, `i` is shared between the two `int` calls, but not with the `double` call.
